            The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota
            Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota
            Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived
            from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".

            Its Ninja H2R track-only variant is the fastest and most powerful
            production motorcycle on the market, producing a maximum of 310
            horsepower (230 kW) and 326 horsepower (243 kW) with ram-air.[1] The
            H2R has 50% more power than the fastest street-legal
            motorcycles,[which?] while the street-legal Ninja H2 has a lower
            power output of 200 hp (150 kW)[21]–210 hp (160 kW) with ram-air.

            In the year 1951, technicians from Daimler Benz, accompanied by
            Brazilian specialists, carried out studies to analyse the viability
            of producing vehicles in Brazil. Two years later, on 7 October 1953,
            Mercedes-Benz do Brasil was officially founded, having as its first
            president Alfred Jurzykowski. A plant was then built in São Bernardo
            do Campo (a city neighbour to São Paulo city) in São Paulo State. On
            28 September 1956 the plant was inaugurated in the presence of the
            then President of Brazil, Juscelino Kubitschek. This date marks the
            birth of the Brazilian vehicle industry.

            The Tesla Cybertruck is an upcoming battery electric light-duty
            truck announced by Tesla, Inc. in 2019. Three models have been
            announced, with EPA range estimates of 400–800 kilometers (250–500
            mi) and an estimated 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 2.9–6.5 seconds,
            depending on the model. The stated goal of Tesla in developing
            the Cybertruck is to provide a sustainable energy substitute for the
            roughly 6,500 fossil-fuel-powered trucks sold per day in the United
            States.
